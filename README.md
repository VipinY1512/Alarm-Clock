Alarm Clock Project
This project is an interactive alarm clock application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides various features to set alarms, display the current time, manage a list of alarms, and delete specific alarms.
Features

1.Clock Face:
Displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
Updates in real-time to reflect the current time.
2.Set Alarm:
Input boxes allow users to set alarm time (hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM).
Upon clicking the "Set Alarm" button, the specified alarm time is added to the alarms list below.
3.Alarms List:
Displays a list of all alarms set by the user.
Each alarm entry includes the set time and an option to delete the alarm.
4.Delete Alarm:
Provides a delete button for each alarm entry in the list.
Deleting an alarm ensures that it does not trigger an alert when the set time is reached.
5.Alert Functionality:
When an alarm goes off, an alert using JavaScript is triggered in the browser to notify the user.
